Executive Summary

Which problems are you trying to solve ?


The problem of paper volunteer applications, which increases pressure on the human element in the university, in addition to the possibility of an error rate that may be limited, so the solution was to replace the human element with an electronic system consisting of a website that transforms all this pressure into an electronic system that can solve the problem with ease

The system’s suggestions are : 

A separate system from the university system, so that it is a site that easily deals with upcoming requests or is not affected by any pressure on the university’s servers.
The problem: The university cannot share student data with the system, so the system is forced to be within the university boundaries

Suggestion of a system : 

that the system be detailed so that it is divided into sections, and each section has a specialized admin for this specialization, so that this experience will improve those who develop the stages of benefiting from the volunteering stage, which many students consider a transient and useless stage

Problem: It is not possible to have more than one admin available for the volunteering phase in general

Suggestion : 

Put more freedom for institutions that want to enter the system so that we create their own databases for them. They can request students to volunteer within their borders, and this reduces the work of the university and even comforts the university and the human element inside the university

Problem : 

This will make the databases too big for the university website to handle
