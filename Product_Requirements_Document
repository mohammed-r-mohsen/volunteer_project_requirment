Objective/Objective : 

Explain why you are building this and what you hope to achieve.

To relieve the pressure of volunteer requests and facilitate the volunteering process in general, so that we want to convert it from paper to electronic. Our goal, which we seek, is to transfer all requests of companies and students to this system, so that the human element should only be an observer of this system.

Features:
1- Transferring applications electronically:

 the volunteering process in general gives more speed, accuracy and freedom of choice in terms of place and specialization or depending on the volunteerâ€™s choice

2- Non-interference of the university directly: 

in some operations, the system can link all parties to each other without interference from the human party


3- Entry of new institutions : 

 and new cooperation with the university is easier than before, as this method will make companies prefer cooperation with the university without the presence of official contracts or official matters between the two parties

 System and environment requirements : 
 
 The system is supposed to be able to run on all systems at the end of the development stage
